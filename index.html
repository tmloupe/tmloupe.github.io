                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>I'm an up-and-coming developer from just outside of New Orleans, LA. I graduated from <strong>Loyola University
                        New Orleans</strong> in May 2018 with a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</strong>
                    and a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Psychological Sciences</strong>, <em>summa cum laude</em>.</p>
                <p>I enjoy a good read and a good video game. My favorite book is <em>A Clash of Kings</em> by George
                    R.R. Martin; my favorite video game is <em>Rhythm Heaven Fever</em>, by Nintendo. I mostly
                    enjoy role-playing games, but I don't shy away from other genres.</p>
                <p>Indoors are my preferred state, but don't be weirded out if you see me out in 50 degree Fahrenheit
                    weather - I'm a sucker for the cold. Or maybe it's just the perfect blanket weather.</p>
                <p>I am also obsessed with otters. They're viciously adorable.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Programming Interests</h2>
                <p>I code in quite a few languages. I have experience in <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>,
                    <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>Python (my one true love)</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS/SCSS</strong>,
                    <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong>, and <strong>LISP</strong>. I've also worked extensively with templating
                    engines such as <strong>Mustache</strong>, <strong>Twig</strong>, and <strong>Jinja2</strong>. I
                    have some knowledge of database management: I've used <strong>MySQL</strong> and <strong>PostgresQL</strong>.
                    I have used frameworks and libraries such as <strong>jQuery</strong> and <strong>Bootstrap</strong>
                    to help develop.</p>
                <p>I mostly enjoy writing in Python, HTML, and CSS and integrating them with templating engines. I am
                    always open to learning <strong>all</strong> programming languages and concepts.</p>
                <p>I have worked in <strong>Drupal</strong> CMS and <strong>Grav</strong> CMS, from front-end user,
                    content, and configuration management to back-end system and template code. I'm familiar with
                    Ruby's <strong>Sinatra</strong> gem to create a web application, and I am learning how to use
                    Python's <strong>Django</strong> to create a web application. I am also familiar with static site
                    generators, such as <strong>Lektor</strong>.

                <p>

                        <dt><strong>Ozanam Inn Homeless Shelter</strong>, <em>February 2015-April 2015</em></dt> 
                        <dd>I participated in service work in the computer lab for homeless men in New Orleans, helping them connect with others through the internet, learn how to use various software such as Microsoft Word and Excel, and helped educate them on good internet practices.</dd>
                        <dt><strong>Career Path NOLA New Orleans, LA Website Enhancement and Update</strong>, <em> September 2017-December 2017</em></dt>

                        <dt><strong>Loyola University New Orleans, Web Production Assistant/Intern</strong>, <em>November 2017-May 2018</em></dt>
                        <dd>I assisted Loyola University New Orleans' Webteam in various aspects of the ecosystem of sites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and learned Drupal 6 and 7 technologies.</dd>
                        <dt><strong>Loyola University New Orleans, Web Developer</strong>, <em>June 2018-Present</em></dt>
                        <dd>No longer an intern but a full-time web developer, my role largely played the same, but with the addition of meeting with Loyola University New Orleans' key stakeholders and various agencies for update and maintenance to the Loyola web ecosystem.
